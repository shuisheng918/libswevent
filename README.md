- libswevent is a light weight net event library. 
- Support events : socket read write, timer, signal, prepare, check.
- Similar to libevent, redesign a event library just because we want more simple to use, more efficient and less memory.
- Currently supporting platform: linux(use epoll), Windows(use select), FreeBSD(use kqueue), MAC(use kqueue, have not test).
